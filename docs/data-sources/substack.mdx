To add any Substack data sources to your app, just add the sitemap.xml of that url as the source and set the data_type to `substack`.

```python
from embedchain import Pipeline as App

app = App()

# source: for any substack just add the sitemap.xml url
app.add('https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/sitemap.xml', data_type='substack')
app.query("Who is Brian Chesky?")
# Answer: Brian Chesky is the co-founder and CEO of Airbnb.
```
