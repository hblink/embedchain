4. Give it a handle and an optional description.
5. Select `Use API`.

7. Copy your api key and paste it in `.env` as `POE_API_KEY`.
8. Start the bot.

```bash
python -m embedchain.bots.poe
```

If you want to run the bot on another port, you can pass `--port option` like

```bash
python -m embedchain.bots.poe --port 5000
```

9. Click `Run check` to make sure your machine can be reached.
10. Make sure your bot is private if that's what you want.
11. Click `Create bot` at the bottom to finally create the bot
12. Now you bot is created.
